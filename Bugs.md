# Bugs  
This `.md` file states the bugs encountered during debugging and playtesting. There might be more bugs deep in the code that I haven't seen yet. Will update accordingly.

## All Bugs
- Stamina does not reduce even after reaching 0 while holding Left Shift.
- Jumping while in the air or clicking the jump button again reduces stamina.
- If Hunger reduces to 0, then thirst will stop reducing.
- Hunger and Thirst Stats are not being saved or loaded. (Can be both)
- Only 2 Stats are getting stored currently on the code level.
- Interaction Raytrace is triggered from the beginning, instead of getting close to the object.
- Actor Transform not being saved correctly.
- Harvestable Tree code not working, so implemented using Blueprints, which is correctly destroying the MainTree mesh but not spawning the StumpTree mesh.
- Harvest State of Trees are not saved properly. (It was actually not being loaded properly).
- Interaction Rayrace not working on mushroom (Interaction Trace or Actor not being added to InteractionActor Array).
- Inventory not opening if no items added beforehand. It also doesn't open even after picking up an item after initially opening an empty inventory. (Fixed in previous commits).
- Cannot pickup actor again after regrowth and `OnDayChange` breakpoint not hitting.
- Time not updating correctly as the day change does not get loaded once saved.

## Current Bugs
- Cannot pickup actor again after regrowth and `OnDayChange` breakpoint not hitting.

### Fixed Bugs Code
- Jumping while in the air or clicking the jump button again reduces stamina.

  - Fixed Code:  
    ```cpp
    void ATFPlayerCharacter::Playerjump()
    {
        if (ATFCharacter::CanJump() && !GetMovementComponent()->IsFalling())
        {
            ATFCharacter::HasJumped();
        }
    }
    ```

- Hunger and Thirst Stats are not being saved or loaded. (Can be both) - It was both.

  - Fixed Code:
    ```cpp
    FSaveComponentsData UStatlineComponent::GetComponentSaveData_Implementation()
    {
        FSaveComponentsData Ret;
        Ret.ComponentClass = this->GetClass();
        Ret.RawData.Add(Health.GetSaveString());
        Ret.RawData.Add(Stamina.GetSaveString());
        Ret.RawData.Add(Hunger.GetSaveString());
        Ret.RawData.Add(Thirst.GetSaveString());
        // Add Additional Data added here needs to be included in the SetComponentsSaveData_Implementation().

        return Ret;
    }

    void UStatlineComponent::SetComponentSaveData_Implementation(FSaveComponentsData Data)
    {
        TArray<FString> Parts;
        for (int i = 0; i < Data.RawData.Num(); i++)
        {
            Parts.Empty();
            Parts = StringChop(Data.RawData[i], '|');
            switch (i)
            {
            case 0:
                Health.UpdateFromSaveString(Parts);
                break;
            case 1:
                Stamina.UpdateFromSaveString(Parts);
                break;
            case 2:
                Hunger.UpdateFromSaveString(Parts);
                break;
            case 3:
                Thirst UpdateFromSaveString(Parts);
                break;
            default:
                //Log Error
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- Only 2 Stats are getting stored currently on the code level.

  - Fixed Code:
    ```cpp
    TArray<FString> StringChop(FString Source, char split)
    {
        TArray<FString> Ret;
        FString LSide, RSide;

        while (Source.Split(&split, &LSide, &RSide))
        {
            Ret.Add(LSide);
            Source = RSide;
            LSide.Empty();
        }
        if (!RSide.IsEmpty())
        {
            Ret.Add(RSide);
        }

        return Ret;
    }
    ```

- Interaction Raytrace is triggered from the beginning, instead of getting close to the object.

  - Fix Explanation:  
    There were no issues with the previously deleted code. The issue was that there was no collision mesh set for the door; hence, the `InteractableActors` array was not populating with the objects that have `InteractionInterface` implemented. I was unaware that the meshes from Quixel Bridge did not have preset collision, which is why I did not add a collision mesh using C++. (Currently removed all `UE_LOG` logging from previous commits to keep the code clean).

- Actor Transform not being saved correctly.

  - Fix Explanation:  
    Added `ISaveActorInterface` to `TFCharacter.h`. (I remember adding that when I created the `SaveActorInterface` class, idk what happened to it later).

- Harvestable Tree code not working, so implemented using Blueprints, which is correctly destroying the MainTree mesh but not spawning the StumpTree mesh.

  - Fix Explanation:  
    `MarkComponentsRenderStateDirty()` - This is meant to update new meshes at runtime.

- Harvest State of Trees are not saved properly. (It was actually not being loaded properly).

  - Fix Explanation:  
    Changed the load game logic in `TFGameInstance`. At first the code finds the actors which were marked as **spawned** and destroys them, it then loops through the save actor data and respawns them and also restores their transform and their state. (This was very difficult to fixâ€”almost gave up thrice fixing this! Took help from StackOverflow and also the Unreal Enigne forums. Also, I noticed a bug that the `TFDoorBase` is not saving its state correctly).

- If Hunger reduces to 0, then Thirst will stop reducing. (Fixed Long ago when this code was added).

  - Fix Solution:
    ```cpp
    void UStatlineComponent::TickStats(const float& DeltaTime)
    {
        TickStamina(DeltaTime);
        TickHunger(DeltaTime);
        TickThirst(DeltaTime);
        if (Thirst.GetCurrent() <= 0.0 || Hunger.GetCurrent() <= 0.0)
        {
            return;
        }
        Health.TickStat(DeltaTime);
    }
    ```
- Inventory not opening if no items added beforehand. It also doesn't open even after picking up an item after initially opening an empty inventory.

  - Fix Explanation:  
    Made blueprint changes to the UI aspect and also to the `BP_ThirdPersonCharacter` graph to fix this issue.
    
- Interaction Rayrace not working on mushroom (Interaction Trace or Actor not being added to InteractionActor Array).

  - Fix Explanation:   
    I again forgot that items imported from quixel do not have a collision mesh. Now after adding collision its working pefectly fine as intended.

- Time not updating correctly as the day change does not get loaded once saved.

  - Fix Explanation:   
    Changed StringChop function while keeping the same logic behind. The issue was that the split char `|` was not being seperated by the code (but somehow works correctly on different uses such as `StatlineComponent`?). So now this is correctly reading and seperating the different inputs in `Source`.   
    - Solution Code:
    ```cpp
    TArray<FString> StringChop(FString Source, char split)
    {
	    TArray<FString> Ret;
	    FString Push;
	    for (int i = 0; i < (int)Source.Len(); i++)
	    {
		    if (Source[i] == split)
		    {
			    Ret.Add(Push);
			    Push.Empty();
		    }
		    else
		    {
			    Push += Source[i];
			    if (i == ((int)Source.Len() - 1))
			    {
				    Ret.Add(Push);
			    }
		    }
	    }
	    return Ret;
    }
