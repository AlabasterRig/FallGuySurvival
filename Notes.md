# Ideas for future iterations  
This markdown file is for future ideas to be implemmented - may or may not implement but will try. Mostly by seeing a video or something.
- Add an Inventory System.
- Add harvestable trees.
- Save Actor transform and their states.
- Add a Grass painting tool (Have to learn from scratch).
- Day/Night Cycle. - (Do from blueprints maybe).
- Weather Effects (Sunny, Rainy, etc) - (Have To learbn this as well lol).
- Basic Weather Effects on character (heat, Cold) - (Even this I gotta learn)
- Better Logging (or maybe just adding clarity to issues in logging.h) - (I'll Just see a video, will be better than my current).

# Explanation to how things are made to work  
Might Explain the Additions or Changes done in the project (or might not lol), will be using mostly for issues.


# FYI
I realise my mistake of commiting too many times unnecessarily in a single day, and what I mean by that is I change .md files on GitHub instead of the editor i'm using, and the reason being is that I am not confident to add stuff to .md files without previewing it first and hence the the bloated no. of commits. So if you do see high number of commits please do check for its content and the changes done to it.  

I also realise my error in the commit messages, as I have too much information for the changes to provide in a iteration done, I just keep on adding characters in the commit message, henceforth i'll use the description provided with each commmit message to provide more information of the changes made in an iteration.  

I don't know for sure, but Cloning this repository might not provide anyone with the necesarry files to play the game as I think these are just references to the files I create and change in Unreal Engine and all the blueprint scripting will mostly not be available for anyone to see and provide changes on.  
I am not aware of any other way of providing an insight to the development of this project and the constant iteration I do in it. I don't even know where else to store this project to be honest as it has a huge file size.   

**<mark>My main focus was to show the coding aspect of the game along with its logic.</mark>**
